The CRUD-App repository follows a typical MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack structure, which is commonly used for full-stack web applications. Here’s a breakdown of the likely code structure and components used:

1. Root Directory
Contains general project configuration files:

package.json – Lists dependencies and scripts for both backend and frontend.

2. Backend (Server)
Located inside the backend folder. This contains the server-side logic.

Main Components:
server.js / index.js

Entry point of the backend server.

Sets up an Express.js server.

Connects to the MongoDB database.

Defines middleware (like body-parser, cors).

Starts the server on a specific port.

routes/

Contains route handlers for CRUD operations.

Defines API endpoints (e.g., /api/users, /api/products).

models/

Contains MongoDB Mongoose schemas/models to structure database collections.

controllers/

Handles business logic for each route.

Fetches data from the database and processes it before sending a response.

config/

Stores configuration files (e.g., MongoDB connection, environment variables).

3. Frontend (Client)
Located inside the frontend folder. This contains the user interface.

Main Components:
public/

Contains static files like index.html, favicon, and assets.

src/

App.js – Main React component that renders the UI.

index.js – Entry point that renders App.js to the DOM.

components/ – Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, tables).

pages/ – Separate pages/views for different features (e.g., Home, Create, Edit).

services/ – API calls using fetch or axios to interact with the backend.

Tech Stack & Libraries Used
Backend

Node.js – JavaScript runtime.

Express.js – Backend framework.

MongoDB – NoSQL database.

Mongoose – ODM for MongoDB.

CORS – Handles cross-origin requests.

dotenv – Manages environment variables.

Frontend

React.js – UI framework.

React Router – For navigation.

Axios / Fetch API – Handles API requests.
